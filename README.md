## Discord openai bot

This bot uses the openai library to create a smart and fast bot. Currently this bot only utilizes the text-davinci-003 model. This AI has been trained to answer any and all questions. Using the model this bot has been adjusted to answer questions but also in a "condescending" manner.

For more on the openai model please see [here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3)

## To install and make your own

Download the repo and adjust your .env to utilize your discord bot token and your openai apikey.

If you are wanting to run local and not use repl you will need to remove the server.js and any references in index.js to server.js.

Once removed you can run node index.js to begin running the bot in discord.
